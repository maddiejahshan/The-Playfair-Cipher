# The-Playfair-Cipher
# The playfair cipher is an encryption technique used for secure communication. It was invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854 but was popularized by Lyon Playfair during the Crimean War. This cipher is a type of substitution cipher that operates on pairs of letters (digraphs) rather than individual letters. It uses a 5x5 grid and swaps the location of each letter depending on original location and where the letter falls in the password.
